2048 Python
Based on the popular game 2048 by Gabriele Cirulli.
The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048.
Here is a Python version that uses TKinter!
The 2048 game is a simple, addictive puzzle game where the player combines tiles on a grid to create a tile with the number 2048. The game is played on a 4x4 grid, and each round, a new tile with the number 2 or 4 is randomly placed on the grid. The player can then move the tiles on the grid using the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to combine tiles with the same number. When two tiles with the same number are combined, they merge into one tile with the sum of the two numbers. The goal of the game is to create a tile with the number 2048.
To start the game, run:
python 2048.py
